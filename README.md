# ML-Supervised-Learning-Project-Cost-Analysis-and-Attribute-Impact-in-the-Automotive-industry
 Project: "Performing EDA on auto dataset to identify cost-attribute relationships. 
 Goal: Build predictive model for accurate cost estimation.



Supervised Learning Problem:
The supervised learning problem being tackled in this project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an automotive dataset to identify and understand the relationships between the cost (target variable) and the 26 attributes (features) in the dataset. The goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate the cost of an automotive component or service based on its associated attributes.

Significance and Potential Applications:
Understanding the relationship between the cost and various attributes in the automotive industry can have several important applications:

Pricing and Cost Estimation: By identifying the significant attributes that impact the cost of automotive components or services, manufacturers and service providers can better estimate the pricing of their products or services. This knowledge can help in optimizing pricing strategies and staying competitive in the market.

Cost Optimization: For automotive manufacturers, understanding the factors that influence the cost allows them to identify areas where cost optimization is possible. By focusing on these areas, they can reduce production costs, increase profitability, and offer more affordable products to consumers.

Supply Chain Management: A deeper understanding of the cost drivers can help optimize the supply chain. Manufacturers can identify cost-effective sources for specific attributes or materials, thereby reducing overall production costs.

Product Development: Insights gained from the analysis can guide the design and development of new automotive components. Engineers can focus on attributes that have a significant impact on cost without compromising the quality of the final product.

Decision Making: The knowledge obtained from the analysis can aid in making informed business decisions. Executives and stakeholders can use this information to strategize and prioritize investment in certain attributes or aspects of their products or services.

Consumer Insights: Understanding how specific attributes affect the cost can provide valuable insights into consumer preferences and behavior. This information can guide marketing efforts and help in the development of targeted advertising campaigns.

Overall, the significance of this project lies in its potential to provide actionable insights to the automotive industry, leading to cost-effective and competitive products and services. Additionally, the results of this analysis can pave the way for the development of predictive models to estimate costs in real-time, supporting decision-making processes and enhancing the overall efficiency of the automotive sector.
